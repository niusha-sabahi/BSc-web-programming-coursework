# BSc-web-programming-coursework
This repository contains my coursework for my Web Programming module, completed during my BSc Computer Science Degree. 

This coursework was a Web Development project where I created several dynamic web pages for a wedding booking website, which was connected to a database. PHP, HTML and CSS were used to create this website and SQL was used to query the database for relevant data.
